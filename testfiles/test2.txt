1) What are different artifacts you need to create - name of the artifacts and its purpose
   main.tf ,varible.tf terraform.tfvars
2) List the tools you will to create and store the Terraform templates.
   Vscode
   Gitrepo/Azure Repo
   storage account  

3) Explain the process and steps to create automated deployment pipeline.

Create a service connection   
Push the code -- Azure repo
  create a CI pipeline ( add empty job --> Copy task (it will copy the files from repo)
                                           publish task -- it will publish the artifacts in build pipeline
                                           publish artifact task -- it will publish the artifact in the drop folder  which is the source of release pipeline(cd)
  Create a CD pipeline (release)  -- add the artifact- choose source as build 
                                     add stages - dev ,QA .prd
                                     stages -add tasks 
                                                   import terraform plugin from azure market place 
                                                   1)terraform init  (it is initate the environment )
                                                   2)terraform plan  
                                                   3)Terraform apply --autoaproval  (it will provistion the resources in the azure .
                                     configure the tirggers promot to different enivironments 


   
4) Create a sample Terraform template you will use to deploy Below services:
please check the .tf files related to below resources .
Vnet
2 Subnet
NSG to open port 80 and 443
1 Window VM in each subnet
1 Storage account
5) Explain how will you access the password stored in Key Vault and use it as Admin Password in the VM Terraform template.

1)Create Keyvault & Secret resource 
2)Create a data with vault uri

data "azurerm_key_vault_secret" "mySecret" {
name = "labuser"
vault_uri = "https://winkeyvault.vault.azure.net/"
}

3)access the password as like below 
admin_password = data.azurerm_key_vault_secret.mySecret.value
