Two pipelines : Build pipeline and release pipeline 

Build pipeline : if anybody make changes in the repository automtically get the code from repo and it will test, build and publish the artifact into the drop folder

Release Pipeline: it will deoply artifact to the respecive environments ..Dev-- QA -- prd
1) The build should trigger as soon as anyone in the dev team checks in code to master branch.
When Devloper push the code to master branch that build pipeline will be auto triggered as configured the trigger in the pipeline 
Build pipeline
triggers -->enable continuous integration
branch filters
 type           brach specification
 include        master

2) There will be test projects which will create and maintained in the solution along the Web and API.

Create build pipeline >> select Azure Repository -->Autherize it .
need to be configure the task under agent Job

As it is a Dotnet core application need to use Asp.Net core Template .
Restore - .Net core
Prepare analysis on sonar Cloud   ( If you wanted to configure static code analysis)
Build   - .Net Core
Test    - .Net Core
Publish - .Net Core
Run Code Analysis
Publish Quality Gate result
Publish Artifact       --------------    It will copy the artifact to the Drop folder
need to confiure all required perameters for all above tasks.
if test fails build job will be failing as part of the confiuration in build job .. 


3) The deployment of code and artifacts should be automated to Dev environment

Create release pipeline

Artifacts--> add an artifact -->source type as Build -- project name and source build 
configure trigger as each build completion .

Stages -- Dev ,QA and PROD
 Dev stage -- add task --> Deploy Azure app service - need configure
                            stage name , azure subscription , app type ,app service name , package folder

4) Upon successful deployment to the Dev environment, deployment should be easily promoted to QA and Prod through automated process.
 
 Clone Dev stage to create other QA and Prd
 QA stage -- add task --> Deploy Azure app service - need configure
                            stage name , azure subscription , app type ,app service name , package folder
 Pre deployment conditions --> pre depolyment apporval -- give a user as approver 

 Prd Stage -- add task --> Deploy Azure app service - need configure
                            stage name , azure subscription , app type ,app service name , package folder
 
5) The deployments to QA and Prod should be enabled with Approvals from approvers only.

   Pre deployment conditions --> pre depolyment apporval -- give a user as approver
